Rooftop Restaurant With Great Lake Views
The best thing about this rooftop restaurant is the views of Lake Pichola and the buildings
 around it including the City Palace and the Taj Lake Palace. Indian, Chinese, and Continental 
food is served. There is inside and outside seating. It's nice to sit outside whenever 
the sun isn't shining! Breakfast is a great time to kick back with some coffee and an 
omelette and watch everything coming to life on the lake. Late afternoon is perfect to
 relax and watch the sunset over the lake. In the evening when it's dark, the City Palace
 and the Taj Lake Palace are both lit up. The food is good (I loved the thali) and prices
 are reasonable. We happened to be staying here (excellent place to stay too) but even if
 you're not, be sure to stop by for a meal!</i><br><br>
