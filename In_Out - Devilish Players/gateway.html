This restaurant is a pure veg restaurant located on the main City Palace road. 
It is likely that you will pass it a few times during your stay in Udaipur. Usually places 
that are right in the middle of the tourist trail tend not to be so great. Fortunately that was not the case here.
We stopped in one afternoon for a late lunch. The food was very good. We all had Indian
 dishes. I loved the bhindi masala (always my go-to dish in a veg restaurant) and really 
loved the crispy baby corn, which I hadn't had before (think fried mozzarella sticks).
 The atmosphere was very relaxing - loved the outdoor seating, which was one flight up
 overlooking the street (great for people-watching). Prices were very reasonable. 
We enjoyed our meal so much that we went back a second time. I'd definitely recommend
 eating here. 

Open 9:00 am â€“ 10:00 pm for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.</i><br><br>
