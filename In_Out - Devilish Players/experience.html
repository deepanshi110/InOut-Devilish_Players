<i style="font-size:30px; color:black;font-family:Brush Script MT">We spent two days in Udaipur. We took the Kingfisher Red Mumbai-Udaipur flight . Udaipur 
was gorgeous with the full lakes and of course the Lake Palace, where we stayed, was a 
dream in white marble. We were lucky for the monsoon being so good because the lake was
 full - hard to imagine that we were paying non season rates - not that we were complaining! 
There's one Maharaja Arvind Singh who owns most of the tourist places in Udaipur, we
 found that everything we ventured to see had a high entry fee - for instance he has a 
crystal museum that's like 500 bucks per head to see. It's not like he bought the crystal,
 he inherited it! 500 bucks a head? You get a complimentary non alcoholic drink.
The next day onwards we booked a vehicle (through Gemar Singh) which came to pick us up
 at 11am, so till then we did the boat ride to Jagmandir Island (a must do!) and the tour 
of the City Palace. There are Tourism facilitation Centres all over the City from where you can buy tickets to see the different museums etc - there's one composite ticket you can buy for the boat ride, city palace tour, crystal museum tour and vintage car gallery for about Rs. 800 - we stupidly did everything a la carte so it wound up being a lot more expensive! The City Palace and Vintage Car Museum was fun - for the latter we had a particularly enthusiastic guide who gave us a lot of trivia on the cars.
